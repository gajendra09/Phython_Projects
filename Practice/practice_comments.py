Commenting
# in a piece of code if we need remember a step we use comment before the code and
 if we need to skip a line in code we use comment.

we have two types of commenting
1.singleline commenting : in this we add shift+3 before the line to add a comment
                          we use ctrl+? : if we need to add a comment in that line
                          if we need to add comment to a line after the code we use 'space Shift+3'
2.multiline commenting: in this commenting we write comment in between three double quote open and
                         three double quote closed
